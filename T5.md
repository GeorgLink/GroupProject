# Revenue Streams
projected sales volume: 10,000 licenses
projected revenues: $50,000 

# Financial Plan
3 year period plan: at the end of the first year we will be $7,000 dollars in debt but by the second year we will have risen in popularity enough to break even and start making a profit. By the end of the second year we hope to have 20,000 concurrent monthly licenses and by the end of the third year we hope to have 40,000 concurrent monthly licenses which will make it so we are not in debt anymore and are making a profit from the business. 
## Financial Viability
We believe our business will be financially viable after the 3rd year mark once we have obtained enough popularity to have our revenue outpace our monthly operating costs.
