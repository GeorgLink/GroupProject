# T4 Assignment

for our T4 assignment we made a webpage and made it look like what our page would look like if we were a real business. We have it hosted on Chris Kiihnes domain.

[Here is a link to the page where it is being hosted](https://chriskiihne.dev/cist/index.html)

# Key Partners

## Accel Partners

As our company is new Accel would provide us with start-up funding. Starting up a technology focused company has many financial risks such as server cost, office rental, programmer wages, as well as the initial costs of purchasing computers and internet for the working office. The initial investment from Accel will alleviate the potential risks of a slow start to our company. Cybersecurity is known to result in small initial profits, possibly none, and this investment will allow our company to get off the slow start and build up a reputation without going bankrupt before then.

## Google Partners

Google Partners is a marketing program for advertising agencies or third-parties that manage Google Ads accounts on behalf of other brands or businesses.

Google cloud partner allows new buisinesses like ours to start off the right way by providing online resources to get the company off the ground. As our buisiness grows, so do the benefits that come with cloud. We will then be provided access to marketing resources and advice that will allow us to get our name out there in the antivirus world. We will be using google buisiness for documentation purposes and more within our company which will allow our employees to easily access all of the documents they need in order to do their job. As our buisiness and partnership develops we will easily be able to advertise our products to users of Google.

## Norton Anti-virus

Norton anti-virus is our well known sponsor who is funding us and helping us set our anti-virus software up.

Norton is a well known anti-virus software that will give you even more protection for your computer. They are also helping us improve and fund our current technology. The sponsorship money that Norton will give us will help alleviate costs and make it much easier to set up our servers and make a very strong anti-virus software that can work with Norton.
