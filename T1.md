# T1 Business Opportunity & Market Feasibility

## Customer Segment 

Our target demographic are customers in the United States who are families of 4 people who are generally well off (middleclass or above) who are highely technological and use many internet conencted devices and who are afraid of business' stealing their private information.
These customers have the need of security and protection against the prying eyes of corporate business' that would look to benefit from stealing customers data.

## Value Proposition

Our value proposition is a subscription model whose price corresponds to how many individuals are on the plan. This allows us to be able to be affordable to singular customers and their families as well as being an option for business' to secure everyone in their workplace.

## Linkage

A consumer who would like a variety of subscription tiers so that the higher the tier of the subscription the more benefits the consumer gets. For example, if the consumer has 10 devices they might opt for a higher tier so they can cover more computers. For businesses, they can get the highest subscription tiers that help protect hundreds of devices.

## Overview & Timeline

our plan for the next 5 years is that depending upon how our profit margins look we will either lower the subscription fee or keep it the same or possibly add higher tiers for more protection once the needs arise from new technoloical threats.
