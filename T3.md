# T3 Key Activities & Key Resources

## Key Activities That Create Value Propositions

Our company will be developing digital products. We will solve our customers needs by solving their privacy and security concerns while engaging in online activities. In order to fufill this obligation our antivirus software will be installed on the customers internet connected device and actively scan and monitor for threats that would get detected and if a threat was detected it would remove and or quarantine those malicious files. If a new type of file is downloaded that the antivirus has never seen before a copy of it is uploaded to the antivirus database to be further processed by the AI part of our antivirus in order to calculate whether it is a threat or not, and is double checked by our employees. 

## Key Resources 

Our physical needs would be an office for our employees to work in unison. Our intellectual assests would be a patent on our A.I blockchain driven algorithm (which is an intellectual asset). The blockchain part of our algorithm acts like a protective shield on our clients devices that protects the information that goes back and forth between their devices and our servers from getting out and being abl to identify people from that information. Our human resources would be our employees including software developers and engineers who would develop and maintain our products. Our financial asset would also be our A.I. blockchain driven algorithm we developed. The resources we would own would be our algorithm, the resources we are renting are our server space in the cloud using Amazon Web Services and we also rent the space for our office.

## Usage Of Technological Resources

The computing and communications equipment required for our business would consist of computers for our employees to program on, the server that hosts our website, a business email application used for communication amongst our employees and relevant business partners and for file sharing capabilities we would use the business edition of Google drive.
