# T2 Channels & Customer Relationships

## Channels through which we contact our customer segments

The channels through which we would contact our customers is online social medias like twitter and facebook as well as an email. We would raise customer awareness by online targeted ads that target people who are interested in security and ways to keeping your data private. Customers can evalute our offerings via our website which has a rating system where you can leave 1-5 stars and a paragraph explaining you reasoning. Customers can purchase our products from our website which would be in the form of a license that they receive for a specific amount of time, such as monthly or yearly. We would provide support via our email and customer support on our website as well as being able to contact us through twitter and facebook. Giving customer refunds will take into account their specific circumstance such as how long it has beed since they made the purchase as well as which plan they chose. Refunds will be done through an individual section of our website in which afterwards the claim will be reviewed by our customer support team. The refunder will recieve an email detailing whether or not the refund will be done, and if not the reason for it.

## How we would maintain customer relationships with our customer segments

Our customers would be expecting professional service from us since they are the people who are actively concerened and seeking out security for their online footprint. We would use this professionalism to acquire big clients like companies as well as being professional would help us avoid having controversies since our social media accounts would be professional and not try to make memes or relate to anyone since we are a serious business. The way our customer assistance would work is you would make a ticket and talk to the regular automated assistance services that give you steps to troubleshoot and if those do not work you would be redirected to our technical support team of real people that can help you via message chat or phone call. After any assistance call or message, the customer is given the option to give feedback on the assistance in the same way as leaving feedback on our other services noted before. Any updates to our services or emergencies involving security will be sent out through email and our social media.
